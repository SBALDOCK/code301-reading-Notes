### Diversity and Inclusion

#### Silicon Valley's Gender Gap is the result of computer-game marketing 20 years ago

* In 2014, 70% of the employees at top tech companies in Silicon Valley were male
* In technical roles, it is even more pronounced.
  * Example - Only 10% of technical workforce at Twitter is female
* In the 70's, there was movement toward parity
  * After this, the gap increased and has not been able to recover
  * Dude-centric computer marketing campaigns of the time may be to blame
* Computer and information-technology occupations will grow by 12% between 2014 and 2024, faster than the average for any other occupation
* Women will  not have the same access to opportunities presented in the industry
  * Many companies blame the pipeline, citing poor enrollment and graduation rates among women in tech

* One of the primary reasons can be traced to the close relationship between computing and gaming in the 80s
* Games tended to be more aimed at bosy and men, so it was easy for boys to get a leg up in the area through gaming
* No coincidence that the console touted to have saved the gaming industry was called the **Game boy**
* Experience gap only widened after this
* Studies find that more early exposure to engineering and computing among boys in school creates "more positive attitudes toward and interest in STEM subjects"

* Even when women do have considerable experience with coding and math, the male-dominated environment is an obstacle to entry for many
* The few women who to make it into the field are far less liekly to stay than male counterparts


#### Employee Breakdown of key technology companies

* US Population 
  * 51% female
  * 61% white
* Top 50 US companies under-represent females at 44% and over-represent white people at 78%
* Almost no companies have a representative percentage of female employees
* **Indiegogo** is the closest at 50%
* Non-Asian minority groups are largely under-represented in almost every company measured


#### Why diversity matters to your tech company

* Those new to diversity and inclusion aren't sure how to to talk about it internally and externally and how to rank it among competing priorities
* Helpful to identify why diversity and inclusion matters to you and your company specifically
* Diversity efforts are most successful when they're driven by a commitment from company leaders
* Meaningful commitment requires leaders to understand why diversity matters

* Diverse teams are smarter and more creative
  * "Diverse groups of people bring organizations more and different ways of seeing a problem and, thus, faster/better ways of solving it"
* Diverse companies perform better
  * Strong correlation between diverse organizations and positive financial outcomes
  * "Female representation in top management leads to an increase of $42 million in firm value"
* Companies are losing out on great talent
  * Failing to attract and hire employees from underrepresented backgrounds leads companies to miss out on incredible talent
* Diverse companies can better serve a diverse user base
  * When employees of an organization better represent their uses, they build more effectively for them 
* It's the right thing to do
  * Cultivating an inclusive tech community is simply the right thing to do
