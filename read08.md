* What is SQL?
  * Structured Query Language
  * Designed to allow both technical and non-technical users query, manipulate, and transform data from a relational database
  * Safe and scalable storage for millions of websites and mobile applications
* Popular SQL Databases
  * SQLite, MySQL, Postgres, Oracle, Microsoft SQL
  * All support common SQL language standard
* Relational Database
  * Represents a collection of related tables
  * Tables are similar to an excel spreadsheet with fixed numbers of named columns and rows of data
* What is a Schema?
  * What describes the structure of each table of properties and instances, along with the data type that each table can contain
  * Example - Values in a **Year** column must be integers. Values in a **Title** column must be a string
* Use an **insert** statement in order to add new data into a database
  * Declares table writing to, the column of data being filled, and one or more rows of data to insert
* USE **UPDATE** to update existing data
* Useful tip to avoid mistakes - Always write the constraint first to test it before updating/inserting column/value pairs
* Create a new database table using **CREATE TABLE**
* Use **ALTER TABLE** to add, remove, or modify columns and table constraints
* 

* The goal of learning SQL is to learn how to answer specific questions about data
