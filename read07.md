#### What Google Learned From Its Quest To Build The Perfect Team

* Members speak in roughly the same proportion
  * "Equality in distribution of conversational turn-taking"
  * This doesn't have to be spread evenly on a single idea, but in general all members participate the sam amount

* Good teams have high "average social sensitivity"
  * Members are good at being sensitive to others, being mindful of their expressions and other cues
  * A key indicator are the eyes - "Reading the mind in the eyes test"

* These two traits are known in the world of psychology as "psychological safety...a shared belief held by members of a team that the team is safe for interpersonal risk-taking"
  * Interpersonal trust and mutual respect are the foundations

* Google concluded that psychological safety is the most important factor that leads to the success of a group of collaborators
  * The challenge is implementing this culture with people who might tend to work individually as developers and don't necessarily want to participate in collaborative work
  * Emotional vulnerability amongst team members can bring people closer together and realize that they have more in common than they would have thought 
  * When you can build empathy with others, a trusting connection can lead to a healthier work dynamic

* The conclusion is that there is a link between psychological safety and emotional vulnerability
  * These same two core aspects are important qualities in relationships
  * Human bonds can mean more than the work itself
  * To be safe means being able to bring some of your personal life to work and know that you won't be judged for it...to be able to express fears or a lack of understanding in a safe environment

* Collecting data on psychological safety makes the execution of it easier for those in the tech world, which is traditionally a career type that does encourage the expression of feelings or opinions

#### How I Explained REST to my brother

* Roy Fielding helped write the first web servers
  * HTTP - Tells the browser what protocol to use
  * Next part describes the location of something anywhere in the world from anywhere in the world
  * Foundation of the web

* The WWW is build on an architectural style called **REST**.
  * Provies a definition of a *resource*, which is what most things point to
  * A web page is a representation of a resource
  * A URL tells the browser that there's a concept somewhere. The browser then asks for a specific representation of the concept
  * In most cases, a resource only has a single representation. 

* Web Services / APIs
  * Machines use the web just like people do
  * Computers can use the same protocols to send messages back and forth to each other
  * Machines can only traditionally talk to a small group of other machines
  * They need to be able to talk to all machines about all the information that is present on all other machines
  * Need a way for one machine to tell another machine about a resource that might be on yet another machine
  * Machines do not have a universal way of talking to each other like traditional languages
  * HTTP is all about applying verbs to nouns
  * Computers are not smart enough to use the same verb for many different nouns

* RESTful framework - Ruby on Rails

#### Documentation for SuperAgent

* Lightweight progressive ajax API crafted for flexibility, readability and a low learening curve after being frustrated with many of the existing request APIs
